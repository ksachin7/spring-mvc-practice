# Spring MVC Practices

**Spring MVC (XML Configuration):** This configuration approach utilizes XML files to configure Spring MVC components such as controllers, view resolvers, and handler mappings. It's a traditional method where beans and their dependencies are defined in XML files, offering flexibility and separation of concerns. [Spring MVC XML config.]()

**Spring MVC (Java Configuration):** This modern approach uses Java-based configuration classes to set up Spring MVC components. It leverages annotations like `@Configuration` and `@EnableWebMvc` to configure the application context, controllers, view resolvers, and other settings. It offers more concise and readable configuration compared to XML. [Spring MVC Java config.]()
